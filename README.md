# Numerical_Methods

This repository is for my lab work. This is a basic iterative algorithms. 
<\n>	lab1 is methods for finding the roots of the equation; It's chord method,bisection and Newton's method
<\n>	lab2 is method Lu schedule for solving systems of linear equations
<\n>	lab3 is iterative method for solving systems of  linear equations; It's Jacobi's method
<\n>	lab4 is iterative method for solving systems of not linear equations; It's Newton's method
<\n>	lab5 is interpolation of functions by three methods: Forward propagation Newton, Back propagation Newton and cubic spline
